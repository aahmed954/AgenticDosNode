# AgenticDosNode Demo Application

## Overview

This demo application showcases the complete agentic AI stack capabilities including multi-model routing, RAG integration, cost optimization, and automated workflows.

## Features Demonstrated

### ü§ñ AI Capabilities
- Multi-model routing (Claude Opus/Sonnet, GPT-4, OpenRouter, local vLLM)
- Advanced RAG with semantic search
- ReAct agent patterns with tool usage
- Self-reflection and quality improvement loops
- Extended thinking for complex reasoning

### üèóÔ∏è Infrastructure
- Private Tailscale mesh network
- Docker containerized services
- Vector database integration (Qdrant)
- Cost optimization and monitoring
- Security hardening and sandboxing

### üîÑ Automation
- n8n workflow orchestration
- GitHub integration (PR reviews, issue analysis)
- Real-time monitoring and alerting
- Automated backup and disaster recovery
- CI/CD pipeline integration

## Quick Start

### 1. Bootstrap Deployment

## Demo Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Multi-Model AI Chat
Test intelligent routing between different AI models based on query complexity.

### Scenario 2: Document Analysis with RAG
Upload documents, create embeddings, and perform semantic search with AI analysis.

### Scenario 3: Code Review Automation
Create a GitHub PR to trigger automated AI code review with suggestions.

### Scenario 4: Cost Optimization
Monitor real-time costs and observe automatic model switching for cost savings.

### Scenario 5: Security Testing
Test sandboxed code execution and security monitoring systems.
