# AI Multi-Node Security Hardening Deployment Guide

## Overview

This comprehensive security hardening strategy implements defense-in-depth protection for your multi-node agentic AI deployment. The solution addresses all identified threat vectors while maintaining operational functionality.

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Review and customize configurations
nano deploy-security.sh  # Update email addresses and domains

# 2. Deploy security hardening
sudo bash deploy-security.sh

# 3. Configure Tailscale ACLs
tailscale up --advertise-tags=tag:ai-worker
# Apply ACLs from tailscale-acls.json in Tailscale admin panel

# 4. Start secure containers
docker-compose -f docker-compose.secure.yml up -d

# 5. Initialize Vault
docker exec -it vault-secure vault operator init
# Save the unseal keys and root token securely!

# 6. Run security audit
sudo lynis audit system
```

## Architecture Components

### 1. Network Security Layer
- **Tailscale Mesh**: Zero-trust private network with tag-based ACLs
- **UFW Firewall**: Host-level firewall with strict ingress rules
- **Docker Network Isolation**: Internal bridge networks with no external routing
- **WAF/Reverse Proxy**: OWASP ModSecurity CRS for application protection

### 2. Container Security
- **Seccomp Profiles**: System call filtering for containers
- **AppArmor Profiles**: Mandatory access control
- **Resource Limits**: CPU, memory, and PID limitations
- **Read-only Filesystems**: Immutable container filesystems
- **No New Privileges**: Prevent privilege escalation

### 3. AI Execution Sandboxing
- **Chroot Jails**: Isolated execution environment at `/opt/ai-jail`
- **Cgroups**: Resource limitation and accounting
- **User Isolation**: Dedicated `aiexec` user with minimal privileges
- **Execution Timeouts**: 30-second default timeout for AI operations

### 4. Secret Management
- **HashiCorp Vault**: Centralized secret storage with encryption
- **Automated Rotation**: Monthly API key rotation
- **Encrypted Environment**: AES-256 encryption for environment variables
- **Key Segregation**: Separate keys for different security domains

### 5. Data Protection
- **Encryption at Rest**: AES-256 for vector database and logs
- **TLS Everywhere**: Mandatory TLS for all network communication
- **Conversation Sanitization**: PII removal from logs
- **Integrity Verification**: HMAC for tamper detection

## Security Features

### Authentication & Authorization
- Multi-factor authentication (TOTP)
- JWT-based session management
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Account lockout after failed attempts
- Rate limiting per user/IP

### Monitoring & Alerting
- Real-time security event monitoring
- Prometheus metrics with Grafana dashboards
- Critical alert notifications
- Audit logging to Elasticsearch
- File integrity monitoring with AIDE

### Incident Response
- Automated response playbooks
- System isolation procedures
- Forensic snapshot capability
- Credential rotation on compromise
- Network traffic capture

## Post-Deployment Checklist

### Immediate Actions
- [ ] Change all default passwords
- [ ] Update email addresses in configurations
- [ ] Configure Tailscale tags for your nodes
- [ ] Initialize and unseal Vault
- [ ] Generate TLS certificates for all services
- [ ] Configure backup destinations
- [ ] Set up monitoring endpoints

### Within 24 Hours
- [ ] Run vulnerability scan: `sudo lynis audit system`
- [ ] Test backup restoration procedure
- [ ] Verify all services are using TLS
- [ ] Review audit logs for anomalies
- [ ] Configure SIEM integration
- [ ] Test incident response procedures

### Weekly Tasks
- [ ] Review security alerts and logs
- [ ] Check for system updates
- [ ] Verify backup integrity
- [ ] Review access logs
- [ ] Update threat intelligence feeds

### Monthly Tasks
- [ ] Rotate API keys and credentials
- [ ] Security assessment with penetration testing
- [ ] Review and update ACLs
- [ ] Disaster recovery drill
- [ ] Compliance audit

## Security Boundaries

### Trust Zones
1. **Trusted Zone**: Admin workstations with full access
2. **Semi-Trusted Zone**: AI controller nodes
3. **Untrusted Zone**: AI execution sandboxes
4. **DMZ**: WAF and reverse proxy

### Data Classification
- **Critical**: API keys, credentials, encryption keys
- **Sensitive**: Conversation logs, vector embeddings
- **Internal**: Configuration files, system logs
- **Public**: Documentation, metrics endpoints

## Incident Response Procedures

### Severity Levels
- **P1 Critical**: System compromise, data breach
- **P2 High**: Failed authentication spikes, container escape
- **P3 Medium**: Unusual API usage, configuration changes
- **P4 Low**: Failed backups, expired certificates

### Response Steps
1. **Detect**: Automated monitoring and alerting
2. **Contain**: Isolate affected systems
3. **Investigate**: Forensic analysis and root cause
4. **Eradicate**: Remove threat and patch vulnerabilities
5. **Recover**: Restore from clean backups
6. **Learn**: Post-incident review and improvements

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Container won't start**
```bash
# Check AppArmor profile
sudo aa-status | grep ai-executor
# Check seccomp profile
docker inspect ai-executor | jq '.HostConfig.SecurityOpt'
```

**Vault is sealed**
```bash
# Unseal with saved keys
docker exec -it vault-secure vault operator unseal <key1>
docker exec -it vault-secure vault operator unseal <key2>
docker exec -it vault-secure vault operator unseal <key3>
```

**High memory usage in sandbox**
```bash
# Check cgroup limits
cat /sys/fs/cgroup/memory/ai_sandbox/memory.limit_in_bytes
# Adjust in deploy script if needed
```

**Tailscale connectivity issues**
```bash
# Check node status
tailscale status
# Verify ACL tags
tailscale up --advertise-tags=tag:ai-worker
```

## Performance Impact

Expected overhead from security measures:
- **Network**: 5-10% latency increase from TLS/inspection
- **CPU**: 10-15% overhead from encryption/monitoring
- **Memory**: 200-500MB for security services
- **Storage**: 20-50GB for logs and audit trails

## Compliance Alignment

This implementation supports compliance with:
- **GDPR**: Data encryption, access controls, audit logging
- **HIPAA**: Encryption at rest/transit, access controls
- **SOC 2**: Security monitoring, incident response
- **ISO 27001**: Risk management, security controls
- **NIST Cybersecurity**: All five framework functions

## Advanced Configuration

### Custom Threat Detection
Add custom detection rules in `/opt/ai-security/rules/`:
```yaml
- name: custom_ai_threat
  pattern: 'ignore previous instructions|IGNORE ALL PREVIOUS'
  severity: high
  action: block_and_alert
```

### Extended Monitoring
Integration points for additional monitoring:
- Splunk: Forward logs to HEC endpoint
- DataDog: Agent installation with security monitoring
- Elastic Security: Beats agents for log shipping

## Support and Updates

### Security Updates
```bash
# Check for security updates
sudo apt update && sudo apt list --upgradable | grep -i security

# Update security components
sudo bash deploy-security.sh --update
```

### Getting Help
1. Review logs in `/var/log/ai-audit/`
2. Check container logs: `docker logs <container>`
3. Run diagnostics: `sudo bash deploy-security.sh --diagnose`

## Important Notes

1. **Never disable security features** without documented risk acceptance
2. **Always test changes** in a non-production environment first
3. **Keep audit logs** for at least 90 days (adjust for compliance)
4. **Regular security assessments** are crucial for maintaining security posture
5. **Incident response plan** must be tested quarterly

## Grey Area Considerations

For Claude API proxy usage:
- All traffic is routed through authenticated Tailscale mesh
- API keys are rotated monthly and stored in Vault
- Rate limiting prevents abuse
- Full audit trail maintains accountability
- Consider official API channels when available
