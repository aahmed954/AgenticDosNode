from src.cost_optimization.cost_tracker import CostTracker

cost_tracker = CostTracker()

# Track model usage automatically
await cost_tracker.record_model_usage(
    model_id="claude-sonnet-4",
    input_tokens=1500,
    output_tokens=800,
    project_id="research-analysis",
    user_id="researcher@company.com"
)
```

**Key Features:**
- Real-time token counting and cost calculation
- Project and user attribution for cost allocation
- Historical cost trends and analysis
- Budget alerts and threshold monitoring

### 1.2 Service Cost Breakdown

The system tracks costs across all components:

| Service Category | Components | Typical Cost Share |
|-----------------|------------|-------------------|
| Model Inference | Claude API, OpenRouter, OpenAI | 60-80% |
| Infrastructure | GPU compute (thanos), CPU (oracle1) | 15-25% |
| Storage | Vector DB, model cache, data storage | 3-8% |
| Network | API calls, data transfer | 2-5% |

## 2. Model Selection Optimization

### 2.1 Cost/Performance Matrices

Our optimization system evaluates models across multiple dimensions:

| Model | Cost/1K Tokens | Quality Score | Speed Score | Use Cases |
|-------|----------------|---------------|-------------|-----------|
| Claude Opus 4-1 | $0.090 | 0.95 | 0.40 | Complex reasoning, creative tasks |
| Claude Sonnet 4 | $0.018 | 0.85 | 0.75 | Balanced performance, code generation |
| GPT-4o | $0.035 | 0.80 | 0.70 | General purpose, analysis |
| GPT-4o Mini | $0.00075 | 0.70 | 0.90 | Simple tasks, high volume |
| Claude Haiku 3 | $0.00175 | 0.60 | 0.95 | Summarization, classification |
| Local Llama 3.1-8B | $0.000 | 0.55 | 0.95 | High volume, cost-sensitive |

### 2.2 Intelligent Task Routing

The system automatically routes tasks to optimal models:

```python
from src.cost_optimization.model_optimizer import ModelOptimizer, TaskType

optimizer = ModelOptimizer()

# Get model recommendation
recommendation = await optimizer.recommend_model(
    prompt="Analyze quarterly financial performance",
    task_type=TaskType.REASONING,
    quality_priority=0.6,  # Prioritize quality
    cost_priority=0.4      # Balance with cost
)

print(f"Recommended: {recommendation.model_id}")
print(f"Expected cost: ${recommendation.estimated_cost:.4f}")
print(f"Rationale: {recommendation.rationale}")
```

### 2.3 Bulk Processing Strategies

Optimize batch operations for significant cost savings:

```python
# Optimize batch processing
batch_optimization = await optimizer.optimize_batch_processing(
    requests=batch_requests,
    total_budget=100.0,
    quality_threshold=0.8
)

print(f"Optimal model: {batch_optimization.optimal_model}")
print(f"Cost savings: ${batch_optimization.cost_savings:.2f}")
```
